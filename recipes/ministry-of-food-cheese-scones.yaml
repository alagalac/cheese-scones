commentary: "The award-winning Ministry of Food Catering Company supplies these very cheesy scones to the Ministry of Food Café in the Bowen State Building. The recipe was a favourite provided by Brenda Jessup's mother, Beth. Her family would bake them in a camp oven over the fire on camping holidays."
