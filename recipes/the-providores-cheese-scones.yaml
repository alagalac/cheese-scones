title: "Cheese Scones"
type: "cafe"
prep_time: ""
cook_time: "12-15 minutes"
servings: "6-8"
ingredients:
  - "1 ¾ cups / 270g plain flour"
  - "1 ½ tbsp baking powder"
  - "1 tsp sugar"
  - "¼ tsp salt"
  - "1 tsp smoked paprika"
  - "60g cold butter, diced"
  - "220ml buttermilk (or as I did - 2 heaped tbsp plain yoghurt and the rest milk)"
  - "120g cheese"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 210°C Fan"
  - "Sieve dry ingredients"
  - "Rub in the butter till crumbly. If using your hands place the mixture in the fridge or freezer to cool down for 15 minutes"
  - "Reserve 1 tbsp of the buttermilk for glazing the scones, then tip the rest into the flour and mix in using a table knife until mostly combined"
  - "Add the cheese, mix briefly with the knife, then squeeze together into one ball using your hands"
  - "Tip onto a lightly floured bench, dust with a little flour and roll out 2 – 3cm thick"
  - "Cut into shapes and lay on a lightly floured or parchment-lined baking tray"
  - "Glaze with the reserved buttermilk"
  - "Bake 12 – 15 minutes until golden and risen"
  - "Leave to cool on the tray for a minute then move to a cake rack to cool – or just eat them straight away split open and topped with butter"
notes:
  - "It's important the mixture stays cold"
  - "If using a food processor put the blade in the freezer for 10 minutes before blitzing"
  - "Use whatever cheese you have – grate firm cheeses and dice softer ones (young cheddar, goats etc) and they'll keep some shape and oozing texture"
  - "This mix can also be rolled out 1cm thick and treated like a pizza base topped with thinly sliced tomatoes, mushrooms, prosciutto, extra cheese etc"
commentary: "This scone recipe is from The Providores & Tapa Room Restaurant in London, a beloved institution that served scones for 18 years. Smoked paprika is added in homage to the cheese scones made as a child in Whanganui using cayenne pepper, but you can skip it. Use buttermilk or a mixture of plain yoghurt and milk."
