title: "Dom's Cheese Scones"
type: "cafe"
prep_time: ""
cook_time: "15-20 minutes"
servings: ""
ingredients:
  - "1000g self raising flour"
  - "550g tasty cheese (pre-grated Mainland tasty is what Pravda use)"
  - "875mls homogenised milk (blue top works best)"
  - "150g melted butter (Pravda use unsalted butter but if you're using salted butter just half the salt amount)"
  - "15g salt"
instructions:
  - "Put all the dry ingredients into a large bowl, including the cheese"
  - "Create a well in the dry ingredients and pour the milk and butter in. Combine mixture (remember to fold it in) but do not over work it"
  - "Wet your hands and roll into good even sized balls which can be weighed if desired or done by sight. The most important thing to remember is to be light with the rolling, quick with hands and even in size"
  - "Once the mix is combined, place the rolled balls onto an oven tray lined with baking paper and top the scones with more grated cheese"
  - "Bake at 180 degrees celsius for 15 – 20mins or until golden in colour"
  - "Turn the tray in the oven every five minutes to ensure even baking. Let scones rest for five minutes before serving"
notes:
  - "Use a big mixing bowl and a large wooden spoon for mixing"
  - "Mainland Tasty pre-grated cheese seems to work really well as it's a good consistency"
  - "You can mix the dry ingredients as much as you want before adding in the rest but try to fold the mixture as you would with mousse as you don't want to beat the air out of it"
  - "When mixing, turn the bowl from the top towards you in one direction as you use the spoon to fold in the mixture from the other direction so they both sort of meet in the middle"
  - "Use the wooden spoon to scoop out the mixture to roll – another way to reduce the air escaping"
  - "The key is really wet hands. Run them under water to start with then every second scone, run them under the water again"
  - "When rolling them you want to cup your hands around it and just gently roll it as you don't want to swash the air out of it"
  - "When they're in the oven, just make sure that you turn the tray around every 5mins or so and swap the trays around (high to low) as this helps them to cook more evenly overall"
  - "When trying to tell if they are done or not, base your decision more on the colour of the scones rather than the time that they've been in the oven"
