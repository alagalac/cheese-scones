  - "Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add egg and 250ml (1 cup) of the milk. Gently mix with a wooden spoon until just combined and the mixture is neither dry nor sloppy. Beware of over-mixing. Add extra milk only if the mixture appears dry"

commentary: "Mini loaf forms are available in kitchen shops, usually in trays of eight. The little loaves are a handsome single portion but can also be sliced, as you would a loaf of bread, for petite slices. Toasted petite slices are also an option with this recipe to perhaps serve with soup, or to make cocktail-size sandwiches."
