title: "Cheese Scones"
type: "commercial"
prep_time: "20 minutes"
cook_time: "10 minutes"
servings: "12"
ingredients:
  - "3 cups Edmonds standard grade flour"
  - "3 tsp Edmonds baking powder"
  - "¾ cup grated cheese"
  - "¼ tsp cayenne pepper"
  - "¼ tsp mustard powder"
  - "¼ tsp salt"
  - "75g butter (or Olivani Spread)"
  - "1 ¼ cups milk"
  - "extra milk for glazing"
instructions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 220°C. Grease or flour a baking tray"
  - "Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Add cheese, cayenne pepper and mustard powder to the mixture. Rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs"
  - "Add the milk and quickly mix with a round-bladed table knife to a soft dough. For light and tender scones the mixture should be quite soft and a little sticky. Scrape the dough onto the floured baking tray and flour the top"
  - "Working quickly, pat the dough out to 2cm thickness. With a floured knife, cut it into 12 even-sized pieces, then separate the scones to allow 2cm space between them. Brush the tops with milk"
  - "Before baking, top each scone with a little more grated cheese. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown"
  - "Place on a wire rack to cool, wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep them soft"
