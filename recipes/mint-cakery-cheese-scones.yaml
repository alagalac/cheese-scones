ingredients:
  - "500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting"
  - "2 tbsp baking powder"
  - "1 tsp salt"
  - "½ tsp pepper"
  - "200g grated cheddar cheese, plus extra for the top of each scone"
  - "250ml cream"
  - "250ml lemonade, (I use Sprite)"
instructions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 190°C fan bake. Line a baking tray with baking paper"
  - "Sift your flour, baking powder, salt and pepper into a large mixing bowl"
  - "Add the grated cheese. Mix with a large metal spoon or butter knife to combine"
  - "Pour your cream and lemonade into the dry mixture and mix until it has come together to form a soft dough"
  - "Lightly dust your bench with flour and tip the scone dough out"
  - "Dust the top of the scone dough with flour so your hands don't stick, and gently shape it into a rectangle"
  - "Cut the dough into 8 squares and place each scone onto the baking tray"
  - "Top each one with grated cheese"
  - "Bake for 15-17 minutes, until golden"
  - "Check them at the 15-minute mark, if they're nice and golden, take them out, if not, a couple more minutes will do the trick"
notes:
  - "Best served warm out of the oven with a heap of butter"
commentary: "These Cheese scones are so delicious and easy. Old-school vibes with the cream and lemonade, but they also make them super easy to whip up. Add anything you like to them, too! Bacon, spinach, feta, red onion, the list is almost endless."
