# Cheese scones

A collection of New Zealand cheese scone recipes.

## Rationale

Cafes close, blogs shut down, and cook books go out of print, and every time they take part of our culinary heritage with them. This project is an attempt to collect and preserve the cheese scone recipes of New Zealand for future prosperity.

## Criteria

For a recipe to be included, it must have a New Zealand connection and must be for a cheese scone.
